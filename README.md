# Celera Workflow

This is our attempt at a workflow for using the Celera Assembler on our dataset
of PacBio and Illumina reads.

Currently, this has been tested on OS X 10.9 with gcc/g++ 4.9 from Homebrew.

## Requirements

TODO

## Installation

In theory, it suffices to run:

    ./install_third_party.sh
    ./install_downloads.sh

## Post-Installation

You will need to add <code>/usr/local/pacbio/bin</code> to your <code>${PATH}</code>.
